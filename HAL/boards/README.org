* HAL Board Packages

These "board packages" describe board specific information needed by the
hardware abstraction layer.

Specifically, it specifies:
1. The number of MGTs connected
2. The source of the recovered clock
3. A mapping of the MGT links, including their:
   1. Designation (Felix, Sector logic, CSM, etc)
   2. REFCLK source
   3. GT type (GTH vs. GTY)
   4. X/Y location in the chip
4. Information about the reference clocks
   1. Which REFCLK is used for the C2C link
   2. The "type" of each reference clock (LHC 320/240MHz MHz, AXI C2C, etc)

** Customization of constants
